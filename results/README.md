[Stochastic Kriging-Assisted Simulation with Random Covariates]
by Li, C., Gao, S. and Du, J. 



###### Scripts
*   “comparison with hetGP package”: comparing the random design with **hetGP** package (in Binois et al. 2019),
*   “d1”:  testing the rates of maximal IMSE and IPFS and comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **one**\-dimensional benchmark function examples,
*   “d2”:  testing the rates of maximal IMSE and IPFS and comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **two**\-dimensional benchmark function examples,
*   “d3”:  testing the rates of maximal IMSE and IPFS and comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **three**\-dimensional benchmark function examples,
*   “d10”: testing the rates of maximal IMSE and IPFS and comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **ten**\-dimensional benchmark function examples.
*   “queue”: testing the rates of maximal IMSE and IPFS and showing how the theory can help decide the sample size to achieve a target precision in the **MM1 queue**\-dimensional benchmark function examples.
